Title:
How Emissions Will Impact Wildfire Risk

Abstract:
Climate change has been shown to have a profound effect on the amount of
droughts and wildfires. Specifically, climate change can lead to an increase
in Vapor Pressure Deficit (VPD), which represents the difference between the
level of H2O present in the atmosphere compared to how much water the
atmosphere can hold. With more climate data being available, we were able to
use deep learning models to forecast and emulate Vapor Pressure Deficit. This
gave us a better understanding of which areas have drier vegetation, and as a
result are more at risk of wildfires. With the prevalence of wildfires in various
parts of the world and its relation to climate change, finding ways to efficiently
model Vapor Pressure Deficit can uncover a lot about how certain climate
patterns are correlated with climate change. While many previous studies
have explored temperature patterns in relation to wildfires, climate models
have not been able to accurately model vapor pressure deficit. We developed
a series of climate emulators using a Random Forest model, Gaussian Process
model, and Convolutional Neural Network to measure Vapor Pressure Deficit
